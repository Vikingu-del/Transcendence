# ELK Stack Architecture

## Overview
The Transcendence application uses the Elastic Stack (ELK) for comprehensive logging, monitoring, and visualization of system performance and events. The implementation includes:

- **Elasticsearch**: Distributed search and analytics engine
- **Logstash**: Data processing pipeline for log ingestion
- **Kibana**: Data visualization platform
- **Filebeat**: Lightweight log shipper for forwarding logs

## Component Architecture

### Elasticsearch
**Purpose**: Core search and analytics engine that centrally stores all logs

**Features**:
- Distributed document storage
- Full-text search capabilities
- Real-time analytics
- Scalable architecture

**Configuration**:
- Custom security settings with user authentication
- Optimized heap settings for container environment
- Cluster health monitoring

### Logstash
**Purpose**: Log processing pipeline that transforms and enriches data

**Features**:
- Data normalization and transformation
- Filtering of irrelevant log data
- Structured parsing of container logs
- Event enrichment with metadata

**Configuration**:
- Multiple input/output pipelines
- Custom grok patterns for log parsing
- JSON and multiline log handling

### Kibana
**Purpose**: Visualization platform for exploring and analyzing logs

**Features**:
- Interactive dashboards
- Real-time monitoring views
- Advanced search capabilities
- Saved visualizations for common use cases

**Configuration**:
- Secure connection to Elasticsearch
- User authentication integration
- Custom index patterns for microservices

### Filebeat
**Purpose**: Lightweight log shipper that forwards logs from services to Logstash

**Features**:
- Low resource footprint
- Reliable log delivery with back-pressure handling
- Automatic handling of log rotation
- Docker container log collection

**Configuration**:
- Docker input module for container logs
- Custom prospectors for different log types
- Log enrichment with container metadata
- Secure connection to Logstash with TLS

## Integration Architecture

### Service Integration
**Docker Logging Driver**: Services configured with the json-file logging driver

### Log Shipping Flow:
1. Application services write logs to stdout/stderr
## Log Structure
**Standardized Format**: JSON-structured logs with consistent fields

**Common Fields**:
- **service_name**: Identifies the source service
- **log_level**: Severity of the log entry
- **timestamp**: ISO-8601 formatted time
- **request_id**: Correlation ID for tracing requests
- **message**: Actual log content

## Deployment Configuration

### Resource Allocation
- **Elasticsearch**: 2GB heap minimum, scalable based on log volume
- **Logstash**: 1GB heap for log processing
- **Kibana**: 512MB for visualization server
- **Filebeat**: Minimal footprint, typically under 100MB

### Network Configuration
**Internal Network**: All ELK components communicate on an isolated network

**Port Exposure**:
- **Kibana**: Port 5601 exposed for UI access
- **Elasticsearch API**: Port 9200 (internal only)
- **Logstash input**: Port 5044 for Filebeat (internal only)

### Persistence
- **Volume Mounts**: Elasticsearch data persisted with dedicated volumes
- **Snapshot Strategy**: Regular snapshots for data backup

### Monitoring and Alerts
**Stack Monitoring**: Self-monitoring enabled for ELK components

**Alert Rules**:
- Error rate thresholds
- Service availability checks
- Disk space monitoring
- CPU/Memory usage alerts

## Benefits
- **Centralized Logging**: Single source of truth for all application logs
- **Real-time Visibility**: Immediate insight into system behavior
- **Troubleshooting**: Faster identification and resolution of issues
- **Performance Analysis**: Metrics and trends for optimization
- **Security Monitoring**: Detection of suspicious patterns and activities

This comprehensive logging architecture provides robust observability across all microservices in the Transcendence application.
